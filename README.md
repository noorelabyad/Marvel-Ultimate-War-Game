<p align="justify">
Marvel: Ultimate War is a 2 player battle game. Each player picks 3 champions to form his team
and fight the other player’s team. The players take turns to fight the other player’s champions.
The turns will keep going back and forth until a player is able to defeat all of the other player’s
champions which will make him the winner of the battle.

During the battle, each player will use his champions to attack the opponent champions either
by using normal attacks or using special attacks/abilities. The battle takes place on a 5x5 grid.
Each cell in the grid can either be empty, or contain a champion or obstacle/cover. At the
beginning of the battle, each team will stand at one of the sides/edges of the grid as a starting
position. The game ends when either one of the player's champions are knocked out.
